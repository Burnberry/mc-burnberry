### plan
- Resource game uses nodes class
  - OnHit() + sound
  - Chance of finding gems / ores
  - itemChange
  - isFinished()
- Upgrades
  - Minigame Main menu + view (in inventory?)
  - Game vs player resources/upgrades
  - resource view
  - upgrade view
- minigame on finish restart + escape button
- minigame start by pressing tool (optional)
- Woodchopping
  - Really boring, how to make interesting?
    - if not possible, make it the easiest to automate
    - foraging/hunting instead and add extra things to do
  - Tree with main health
    - Hitting the tree drops leaves
    - Leaves can turn into extra loot
