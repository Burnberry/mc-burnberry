### plan
- Defense
  - monster retarget research
    - 1. only attack base
    - 2. Attack player when possible
  - Base enter/attack detection

- Resource Game
  - Woodchopping 2
    - Really boring, how to make interesting?
      - if not possible, make it the easiest to automate
      - foraging/hunting instead and add extra things to do
    - Tree with main health
      - Hitting the tree drops leaves
      - Leaves can turn into extra loot
  - mining 2
    - random generation (research noise generation)
    - random ore spawns
  - farming
    - food grows with ticks
    - food needed for minions
  - smelting tech
